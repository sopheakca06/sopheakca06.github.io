Hello Everyone! My name is Sopheakca and I am a computer science student at CSUF, I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorie 120L Labs

* Lab 4, Part 2: Hi Lo Guessing Game

    Hi Lo was a guessing game and it consisted of two players trying to guess the other player's secret number. Each player had two attempts to guess what the other player's secret number was, and each player was able to choose what their secret number was for this program. 
        I had liked that you were able to play this with a partner and each player was able to choose their own number, so it was an unexpected output because you wouldn’t know what they would’ve had to put for their secret number. Along with that since it was one of our earlier labs it was interesting to put an “If” statement into the code for one of the first times, since it was an interactive game. Through this I had learned how to place an “If” statement and  what comes with an “If” statement means that there is typically an “else” statement as well to account for a different input.


* Lab 6, Part 2: Blackjack Score

    During this lab, we had to write a program that computes the score for the game Blackjack. Essentially we had to deal with hands that contained two cards, while the objective was to get as close as possible to the score 21 with the two cards given. We had to make a program where you were able to play a game that was interactive and there were multiple outcomes of the output, because you wouldn't know what youre total score of your hands would be. Through this, we had to identify the score after one card, and what made it more complex was the ace card. With the ace card, you have the choice of having the card be a 1 or an 11, and with this came the various possible outputs, where in the program you have to take into account to make sure that if they get over the score of 21, that it's a bust.  
        This was the challenging part of the lab, since there were multiple things to take into an account for the expected outputs. Since it had been challenging, I had learned that there were multiple things that you have to make sure is validated, when writing the code because with this program specifically, there are calculations that need to be done through the numbers given with the two hands for a score. In addition with these scores you had to make sure that there was a code determining whether or not the hands were a bust. Making sure that each score of the different hands were in the expected output and then calculated properly. That’s what I had liked about the lab. 

* Lab 7, Part 1: Parking Rules

    In this lab, we had been asked to write a program, where it determines when cars are allowed to park on different streets.
         In this lab I liked that we had to write arguments that had validated things such as the street name, day, hour and even minute. This had made me make sure that my partner and I had properly identified what each of the components would consist of depending what street we had been working on. Through this I had learned the precision of making sure that these arguments were readable, where if someone were to read the statement, they would be able to apply the days and times cars would be allowed to park there on that specific street, along with when they weren't allowed to park there.
